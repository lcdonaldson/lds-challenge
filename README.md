Notes on the final project

This is not perfect by any means but here is some info on the project during development.

I learned some things about mixing React with an existing html project. Its not as easy as starting a fresh project. There are a lot of things that don't work when attempting to use multiple dom containers
in one project. Especially with CSS. Layouts can be difficult and adding or removing classes is sometimes not possible with existing web components.

Having said that my biggest challenge was simply time and knowing that I just did as much as I could. Like I said, its not perfect but I did finish most of what was asked.  

To run the project just open lds.html in a browser and you should be able to evaluate.
    
*** Important for this project ***  

Access issues to code that was not reachable made it impossible to complete the requirements list.
